Animal.create(name: "White-Tailed Deer", scientific_name: "Odocoileus Virginianus", danger_rating: 666, animal_fact: "These abominations are, unfortunately, in healthy numbers. In fact, there are more white-tailed deer in the US than when Colombus landed. The hooved rats.", predator: false)

Animal.create(name: "Burmese Python", scientific_name: "Python Bivittatus", danger_rating: 2, animal_fact: "They're not native to the U.S., but thanks to pet owners getting bored with (or maybe going broke feeding) huge snakes, escaped pythons are now a runaway population of ravenous wild animals that are decimating the local ecosystem. Estimates are that at least 30,000 and perhaps as many as 300,000 of these huge reptiles, which can reach 15 feet or more, are living in Florida's swamps.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Red-Tailed Hawk", scientific_name: "Buteo Jamaicensis", danger_rating: 2, animal_fact: "Red-tails can dive at up to 120mph and use four sharp talons on each foot to pierce an animal's skin and puncture its vital organs.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Musk Ox", scientific_name: "Ovibos Moschatus", danger_rating: 2, animal_fact: "The muskox, also spelled musk ox and musk-ox, is an Arctic hoofed mammal of the family Bovidae, noted for its thick coat and for the strong odor emitted during the seasonal rut by males, from which its name derives. This musky odor is used to attract females during mating season.", predator: false)

Animal.create(name: "Eastern Coral Snake", scientific_name: "Micrurus Fulvius", danger_rating: 3, animal_fact: "Part of the cobra family, the coral snake is smaller and less aggressive than the rattler, but its venom — a neurotoxin — is more powerful. To distinguish between the coral snake and its harmless lookalike, the scarlet king snake, memorize this rhyme: 'Red touch black, safe for Jack. Red touches yellow, kills a fellow.'", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Least Weasel", scientific_name: "Mustela Nivalis", danger_rating: 1, animal_fact: "Not commonly seen as predators, weasels are actually skilled hunters. They are known to chase prey five times their size, killing them with bites to the back of the head or neck.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Elk", scientific_name: "Cervus Canadensis", danger_rating: 3, animal_fact: "Elk, the better deer. Majestic. Imposing. Monarchs of the forrest. During the rut(mating season) the males are every bit as dangerous as bears; while rasing a calf, the females match this ferocity.", predator: false)

Animal.create(name: "Western Diamonback Rattlesnake", scientific_name: "Crotalus Atrox", danger_rating: 3, animal_fact: "Like others in the pit viper family, these snakes — found in the deserts of the west — lie in wait with heat sensors that tell them when prey is near. Diamondbacks have large venom glands and special fangs that deliver a huge dose of poison (250mg to 750mg) per bite. They can also go months without eating.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "American Badger", scientific_name: "Taxidea Taxus", danger_rating: 3, animal_fact: "Don't. Mess. With. Badgers. Badgers are low-slung with strong necks and thick fur, plus long claws that are basically tiny daggers. Badgers tend to dig up and eat animals that live in the ground, and will hiss, snarl, squeal and slash with those claws when threatened. Bonus defense: they unleash a stinky musk when alarmed, and generally don't give a f***.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Bobcat", scientific_name: "Lynx Rufus", danger_rating: 2, animal_fact: "The bobcat (aka lynx) is an extremely elusive animal, which explains how they manage to persist in such a vast territory, including huge sections of the northeast in close proximity to population centers. Bobcats are loners that can go for long periods without eating, though given the chance, they'll dine on whatever's around. Earlier this year, a guy in Florida photographed one leaving the beach with a shark in its mouth.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Coyote", scientific_name: "Canis Latrans", danger_rating: 2, animal_fact: "Smaller than a wolf but larger than most dogs, the coyote is an opportunist with a ruthless streak. They can eat just about anything, including rotten meat and bones. In 2009, a pack of coyotes in Canada killed an adult human (a female hiker) for the first time in recorded history.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Golden Eagle", scientific_name: "Aquila Chrysaetos", danger_rating: 3, animal_fact: "The golden eagle is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "American Alligator", scientific_name: "Alligator Mississippiensis", danger_rating: 5, animal_fact: "The alligator uses its powerful tail to propel itself through water. While alligators move very quickly in water, they are generally slow-moving on land. They can, however, move quickly for short distances. Alligators are a keystone species benefiting the marshes, swamps, rivers and lakes where they live and many other species found within their natural community.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Moose", scientific_name: "Alces Alces", danger_rating: 4, animal_fact: "Sure, they look dopey and harmless, but a pissed off moose is no laughing matter. The second largest land animal in the U.S., the moose can weigh up to 1,800 pounds and are capable of killing bears, wolves, and even humans, especially in the case of a mother whose young are threatened.", predator: false)

Animal.create(name: "Great Horned Owl", scientific_name: "Bubo Virginianus", danger_rating: 1, animal_fact: "America's largest owl weighs up to five pounds and can fly 40 miles-per-hour in near-total silence. They also have incredible vision and hunt after dark, launching stealth attacks against small mammals that are punctured by their talons, which have up to 500 pounds-per-square-inch of crushing power.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Brown Rat", scientific_name: "Rattus Norvegicus", danger_rating: 1, animal_fact: "If there were some kind of apocalyptic event, this is one species that would survive. The rat's toughness is all about its ability to endure and thrive in hostile environments. Rats can swim, climb, dig, and eat through wood, concrete, and some metal. They breed prolifically and can adjust that rate, making them very hard to exterminate.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Wild Boar", scientific_name: "Sus Scrofa", danger_rating: 4, animal_fact: "The pigs on farms and wild boars are the same animal. When domestic pigs get loose, they undergo a metamorphosis. Their skulls change shape, tusk lengthen and harded, thick fur grows, and they lose their damn minds, going completely feral.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Bald Eagle", scientific_name: "Haliaeetus Leucocephalus", danger_rating: 1776, animal_fact: "'Murica!", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Black Bear", scientific_name: "Ursus Americanus", danger_rating: 5, animal_fact: "These are strong, surprisingly fast animals, capable of running 25 to 30 miles-per-hour. Black bears are excellent climbers and have extraordinary manual dexterity. They can work with latches and handles and have been known to unscrew jars, which seems like a waste of energy for an animal that could just as easily smash them and doesn't much care about making a mess.", predator: true)
	 
Animal.create(name: "Bison", scientific_name: "Bison", danger_rating: 4, animal_fact: "The largest land animal on the continent, bison stand up to six-feet-high at the shoulder and weigh upwards of 1.5 tons. And they're not just big; a bison can run up to 40 miles-an-hour over short distances, and jump fences, so an angry buffalo with two sharp horns on its head is a force of nature that almost nothing short of a high-velocity rifle round can stop. The bison nearly went extint; at one point there were under 200 bison left on the planet. Now they number upwards of 500,000.", predator: false)

Animal.create(name: "Grey Wolf", scientific_name: "Canis Lupus", danger_rating: 5, animal_fact: "Wolves are endurance athletes, capable of covering dozens of miles in a day, with extreme cold tolerance (they can comfortably sleep, exposed, in temperatures as low as -40). While they prefer to hunt smaller, weaker prey, wolves can and often do take on elk, moose, and even bison. A grey wolf's bite strength is 1,500 pounds-per-square-inch—about twice the force of a German shepherd's jaws. The grey wolf is the closest relative of dogs. While grey wolves are canis lupus, dogs are canis lupus familiaris", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "American Crocodile", scientific_name: "Crocodylus Acutus", danger_rating: 5, animal_fact: "Though not nearly as aggressive as their maneater African cousins, male American crocs can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and have been known to snatch cattle on occasion; their normal diet consists of fish, aquatic birds, and small mammals. They're fast on land (10 miles-per-hour) and in water (up to 20 miles-per-hour), and have the world's most powerful jaws, with a bite force that is up to 10 times greater than a Rottweiler's.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Cougar", scientific_name: "Puma Concolor", danger_rating: "5", animal_fact: "These remarkable hunters stalk prey so quietly that often an animal doesn't know it's a target until there's a 150-pound cat on its back. Lions kill by striking from the rear, jumping onto an animal's back and breaking its neck by biting into the base of the skull. These cats are prodigious jumpers, able to leap as high as 15 feet and as far as 40 feet, and they run fast too — capable of reaching 50 miles-per-hour at a sprint. There is a interesting story about cougars. American hunters called them mountain lions because they belived that deep in the mountains lived the older males with large African lion-style manes. They were wrong. That did not stop them from getting themselves killed.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Wolverine", scientific_name: "Gulo Gulo", danger_rating: 5, animal_fact: "Despite weighing just 20 to 50 pounds, wolverines have been known to go after deer and even caribou if they're hungry enough. Mostly, they don't have to, but their voracious appetite means they can devour a smorgasbord of smaller critters (rabbits, squirrels, voles, beavers, etc) in a short period, using sharp, dagger-like claws and a powerful bite with a mouth that includes special molars for crushing bone. These hell-beasts fight bears and win. Don't mess with them unless you're a viking.", predator: true)

Animal.create(name: "Grizzly Bear", scientific_name: "Ursus Arctos Horribilis", danger_rating: 5, animal_fact: "The grizzly's weapons are formidable: They are huge (up to 1,200 pounds, but typically more like 500 to 800), strong (capable of lifting nearly their body weight or more), and powerful, with a bite that could crush a bowling ball. And there's this: Since 1895, there have been 15 reported cases of grizzly bears decapitating moose with a single paw swipe.", predator: true)
